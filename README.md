# Course Overview

Welcome to the Course "Research Data Management in the Energy Sector"! This course is dedicated to give you all the necessary skills to understand the principles and motivation behind Research Data Management (RDM) and enable you to implement RDM in your work and research group.

The course will focus on applicability in the energy sector.

### Roadmap
Insert h5p-map here 

If you complete the whole course, you will have established a basic Data Management plan for a project of your choice that you can build upon and adapt. However, if you have time restraints or already a broad understanding of handling research data, you may choose to go for individual learning sections by clicking on them.

## What is Research Data Management?
Imagine the following scenario: you read a fascinating paper in a neighbouring reseach field. You are immediately intrigued - you could build upon these results with your research! But unfortunately, the data and metadata were not uploaded in a repository. So you try to contact the author of the paper. Unfortunately, she doesn't work at the respective institute anymore and does not have access to the in-house file system anymore. She refers you to her graduate student who did the actual study - but he married and has changed his surname. Finally, you get a hold of him and he sends you the data file - unfortunately, it is full of cryptic acronyms and the software he used to process the data has been discontinued...

Research Data Management aims to break this dynamic by ensuring a sustainable and coherent strategy for all data types, enabling researchers worldwide to improve on cross-disciplinary collaboration, monitoring and replication.
RDM includes all activities associated with

* processing
* storage
* preserving and
* publication
of research data.

### FAIR Principles

For the original paper, see:https://www.nature. articles/sdata201618 UA", which is incorrect

> "As open as possible, as closed as necessary" - this is the main idea behind the FAIR principles. The acronym stands for

* Findable
* Accessible
* Interoperable
* Re-Usable

Which measures make your data FAIRer?       
[[x]] using Creative-Commons or GNU Licenses
[[ ]] keeping processing details undisclosed
[[ ]] ensuring access security 
[[X]] Detailed Metadata    
[[x]] Long-term accessibility in large repositories
