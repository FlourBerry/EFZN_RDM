## <a name="rdm"></a> What is Research Data Management?


### Case Study 



{{1}}
In early 2020, the COVID-19 disease, caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV2, broke out globally, which led to the closure of many shops and businesses for quarantine reasons. The result, especially in the USA, was a large number of unemployed people who urgently needed money for their next rent payment, food or other expenses. As a consequence, the government decided to set up a relief package for anyone who registers as unemployed - but why didn't the money get to the people?

The reason for this was the overload of critical systems on which COBOL is still running. COBOL is a programming language that was developed in the late 1950s to control commercial applications. From today's perspective, the programming language is very outdated and no longer taught in the training of programmers. That is why there was no personnel to take care of the systems when they collapsed. Unfortunately, many applications with the outdated programming language are still running in the business sector.

<details>

<summary> Solution (click to enlarge):</summary>

> There are several solutions possible: Existing systems should be questioned, since requirements can change and established habits can lead to problems from today's perspective. For example, at some point data might no longer be able to be called up or might exist in formats that are increasingly difficult to be processed. A thorough documentation of the programs might also help in some cases to rebuild them in other languages. For timely relief, the administration called out to retired COBOL programmers to work on the issues.

</details>

{{3}}
While maybe not as critical for society at large, scientists can face similar problem when trying to access old data or programs that were written for other purposes but are know needed for the current tasks: Data are insufficiently labeled, have been overwritten, commercial computer programs have been discontinued or process details have not been recorded.

{{3}}
**Research Data Management** (RDM) aims to break this dynamic by ensuring a sustainable and coherent strategy for all data types throughout the research process, enabling researchers to store, access and re-use their own work effectively and safely and opening their findings worldwide to improve on cross-disciplinary collaboration, monitoring and replication.

{{3}}
RDM includes all activities associated with

* processing
* storage
* preserving and
* publication of research data.

### The Research Data Lifecycle

![Lifecycle](img/DataLifecycle.png "The Research Data Lifecycle")

The Research Data Lifecycle. Original source: [UK Data Service](https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/learning-hub/research-data-management/), recreated by Antje Ahrens. Licensed under [CC-BY-4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed.de)

<!-- --{{1}}--
The "Research Data Lifecycle" describes a cyclic process of data generation and management. First, data is created, then processed. The next step is analyzing data, followed by preserving the results. Now, it is time to give access to the data. Ideally, the cycle closes at this point: Data is being re-used and new, well-documented data is being created.
-->


{{2}}
>**Exercise**: 
> Look at each step of the cycle with your data in mind: 
>
> - Which tools or software do you use at each step? 
>
> - Which infrastructure is needed?
>
> - How sensitive is the data at this point?
>
> - How well is the data protected against data loss? Where are possible flaws where data could get lost?
>
> - Does the cycle "close"? Which repositories or platforms do you use to store your results?


### Benefits of RDM
Researchers are
currently spending a significant portion of their own time
dealing with data curation; in some cases, over 50% of their
funded time. (mullendore et al 2021)

[...] 
A coordinated effort is needed to
fund personnel to assist researchers in data and software curation,
as well as investment in the needed repository preservation
and stewardship services, to complement existing capabilities
(Gibeaut, 2016; Mayernik et al., 2018). It is unreasonable to
expect already overloaded researchers to become expert data
managers and software developers, and find time to complete
their research activities.

[...]
Scientific equity
cannot be fully achieved when individual scientists act as
gatekeepers for new models, data, and software

### Open Science

Open Science strives to to make scientific research and its dissemination **accessible to all levels of society**. It encompasses practices such as publishing open research, campaigning for open access, encouraging scientists to practice **open-notebook science** (such as openly sharing data and code), broader dissemination and engagement in science and generally making it easier to publish, access and communicate scientific knowledge. 

Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science 

> **Research Question**:
> 
>Is there an Open Science or Research Data Policy at your institution?
> 
> What is its scope? What is regulated and how?
>
> If not: 
> Would you like to have a Research Data Policy?
> What content should it have?


### FAIR Guiding Principles

**As open as possible, as closed as necessary!**

This is the main idea behind the FAIR principles. The acronym stands for

* Findable
* Accessible
* Interoperable
* Re-Usable

{{1}}
> **Exercise**: Look closely at the graph to identify which measures especially apply to your area of work and data types you are using.

![FAIR Guiding Principles](img/FAIR.png "Source: https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/")

<!-- --{{1}}--
As open as possible, as closed as necessary. This is the main idea behind the FAIR principles. The acronym stands for: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-Usable.

In Detail, that means:
1. To make data findable, you should assign unique and persistent identifiers, that stay active. Also, provide extensive and useful metadata - for example, avoid acronyms. You should also use common repositories. You can find a list on Re3data.com. For the energy sector, we recommend the Open Energy Platform.
2. Accessible data use stanrdized communications protocol such as HTTP or FTP. Make sure anyone with a computer and internet connection can access at least the metadata. Your data and metadata should be long-term accessible. For sensitive data, you may use authentification routines.
3. In order to achieve interoperability, use a formal, accessible, shared and boradly applicable language. Also, use tools and software that are FAIR themselves. Cross-reference your data and metadata.
4. Re-usable data is described by as much information as possible, such as process details. Clearly describe data usage licenses. Be transparent about data provenance and know and meet your own community's data standards.

## <a name="tools"></a> Tools and Strategies

### Tools
A bit outdated, but some helpful software and ideas for a wide range of topics can be found at https://openscience.org/. 

You can create a DMP in a simple Excel-Sheet or use various format templates or tools.
In many tools, you can choose a set of questions that you want to have included in your DMP. Some are focused on data and data formats, other focus on the project structure. If you want to take a look at an example DMP, you can look [here](https://cloud.uol.de/f/7510018536).


> **DMP Task**:
> 
> Now it is time to start your DMP! Choose a **tool** and a set of **questions** that you want to work with and enter your basic project parameters:
>1. Title and Research Question
>2. Project Partners and Institutions
>
>Depending on your settings, you can add other details required by the respective questionnaire. 

Congratulations! You have started your first DMP!

### Legal Aspects
Licenses, informed consent, protection of personal data, access

You should start early to decide which license you would like to put 

---
### Data Types 

Depending on your field of expertise, there will be different data types relevant to your work. In your DMP, you can specify individual datasets and name their identifiers, file size, origin and so forth.
Simulations and software programmes are a special case. Here, not only the resulting datasets are of scientific value but also the programmes, algorithms and settings leading up to the data. ...
The data types you choose to publish have consequences for your Research Data Management in regard to the "Accessible", "Interoperable" and "Re-Usable" Criteria of the FAIR Guidelines.


**1. Accessible**  
--> Make sure that (meta)data are long-term accessible

The amount of memory space needed for long-term, save storage may vary greatly between data types. For example, if your reasearch data consist  of high-resolution images of potential wind turbine sites, memory space needed for backup and repositories will be much higher than a handful .csv files with projected power loads.


**2. Interoperable**
--> Use tools and software that are FAIR themselves
Try to remember the idea of "as open as possible, as closed as necessary.": Strive to choose, where possible, programs and data types that are open and FAIR. For example, do not describe your processing details in a .pdf file, but rather use a .txt-file that can be read and edited with various programs.


**3. Re-Usable**
--> know and meet community standards
As the expert in your own field, you are the one to decide here: which data types are most likely to be found, easily re-used and shared in your scientific community? If these are "closed", you could provide two files: one that adheres to the common standards and a more open alternative that promotes the idea of open science. 

> **Exercise:**
> 
> Make a list of the data types commonly used in your working group and their "FAIR value". Use the criteria in the table below.


| FAIR value|	Machine Readability	| Human Readability	| Long-time Stability|	Metadata   | Example|
| :--------- | :---------| :--------- | :--------- | :---------|:-----------|
|very good |with common open software	|yes and without special software	|normed standard	|completely preserved |  .csv|
|good	|with common and well-documented software	| compressed with standard procedures, but practically yes	|longterm or widely established	| technical details are provided| .xlsx|
|moderate	| proprietary standard format   | with open software (reliably?) convertible to higher class| 	relatively new format	| some important ones (e.g. units) are included | MATLAB file|
|bad	| self-developed reading software| no|	newly developed	| no information    | |

>**DMP Task**: 
>
> If you already know datasets that you will be (re-)using or producing, enter them in your DMP as thoroughly as you can at this point. 
>
> If you do not know your datasets yet, enter one or two "dummy" datasets and follow the respective questionnaire to get an idea of the amount of detail required in the DMP.


### A Special Case: Simulation & Software

Research programmes and simulation software are absolutely essential in energy research. Some researchers are very reluctant in sharing this part of their research work, sometimes because of economic considerations. 

__Research Software in General__

The German Research Alliance (DFG) adresses software development in a research context in its [Guidelines for Safeguarding Good Research Practice](https://www.dfg.de/en/research_funding/principles_dfg_funding/good_scientific_practice/index.html), stating that "software programmed by researchers is made publicly available along with the source code". The source code must be persistent, citable and documented. Certain individual exceptions are possible, though.

So, whether you plan to publish some, all or none of your self-developed software, you have to document well, plan ahead and ensure a good access strategy in your development team.

- Versioning
  
  Various cloud programming platforms such as [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/de-de/) ensure a consistent preservation of all of your software versions, make contributions transparent and simplify collaboration.

- Documentation

  Programmes should be documented and commented, e.g. by stating origin, purpose and scope of a programme, limitations of variables and ideally a short manual.

- Publication

  With journal publication of an article, corresponding software should be cited with version number and a persistent identifier such as a DOI. Choose a software archive with version control. Sometimes, timely open access is not possible. In this case, at least the algorithm used must be outlined completely. If the source code is not published, state the reason and potentially the time period until release.

__Simulation__

Most of the coniderations stated above also apply to simulation. However, with regard to simulation, we are presented with some additional challenges. 

The longevity of simulation outputs is even harder to assess than of observational data. In a 2021 paper on Open Science in Earth System Modelling, [Mullendore et. al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fclim.2021.763420) indentify the following problems:
- Simulations can generate massive output 
- Interdependencies between hardware and software can limit the portability of models and make the longterm accessibility of their output problematic. Models in many cases involve
interconnections between community models, open source
software components, and custom code written to investigate
particular scientific questions. 
- A lack of standardization and documentation for
models and their output makes it difficult to achieve the goals
of open and FAIR data initiatives

The following strategies may be applied when working with simulations: 
- Analyze your project: does it focus on **knowledge** or **data production**? "Most scientific research projects are undertaken with the main goal of knowledge production (e.g., running an experiment with the goal of publishing research findings). Other projects are designed and undertaken with the specific goal of data production, that is, they produce data with the intention that those data will be used by others to support knowledge production research." [(Mullendore et. al. (2021))](https://doi.org/10.3389/fclim.2021.763420)
-  Publish all elements relevant to the simulation, not just source code (see Figure 3[^2]). 
- Publish enough output data to evaluate and re-use your findings, but not all simulation runs
- Some software may be released openly while others remain restricted due to security or proprietary concerns. In this case, the documentation should provide enough information to reproduce the process.

__Checklist for FDM in simulation and software development:__

[[x]] Train yourself and your team in software development quality
[[x]] State the purpose of each programme in a few words
[[x]] Keep your software up to date with quality management
[[x]] Keep the intention of every function clear (by naming or comments) 
[[x]] Choose an appropriate license
[[x]] Establish quality management in your simulation process


>**DMP Task**: 
>
> If you have self-developed programmes in your project, enter them as a separate dataset in your DMP, name all contributors and the purpose of each programme.
